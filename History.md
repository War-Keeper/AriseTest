- Captured implementation blueprint in `luxury-gemstone-website.plan.md` for the Arise Precious Gems inventory experience.
- Built the full static site shell: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` with advanced filters, expandable product cards, and luxury styling.
- Enabled CSV-driven loading with PapaParse, refined placeholder media handling, and wired up certificate linkouts.
- Tweaked pricing logic so "Call For Price" listings display prominently and can be toggled via filters.
- Fixed script loading race by deferring the PapaParse CDN and adding a runtime guard.
- Rebranded all UI copy from “ARHA Stones” to “Arise Precious Gems”.
